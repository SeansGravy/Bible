## Narrative Summaries

### 1. Genesis 1–3, 6–9, 12–50 – **The Beginnings**

God creates the heavens and the earth, forming light, life and humanity.  Adam and Eve’s disobedience introduces sin, yet God promises a future redeemer.  The flood purges the earth, and a rainbow seals God’s covenant with Noah.  The narrative then focuses on the patriarchs: Abram (later Abraham) trusts God’s call and receives a promise of land and descendants.  Isaac and Jacob carry the covenant forward; Jacob wrestles with God and is renamed Israel.  Joseph’s betrayal and rise to power in Egypt prepare the way for the family of Israel to settle there.

### 2. Exodus 1–20, 32–34, 40 – **Liberation and Covenant**

The Israelites groan under Pharaoh’s oppression until God raises Moses.  Through plagues and the Passover, He frees His people and leads them through the Red Sea.  At Sinai, God gives the Ten Commandments and enters a covenant relationship with Israel.  When the people worship a golden calf, Moses intercedes and the covenant is renewed.  Instructions for the tabernacle and its completion show God’s desire to dwell among His people.

### 3. Numbers 13–14; Deuteronomy 5–8, 28–30 – **Wilderness and Preparation**

Spies survey the promised land; fear and unbelief provoke a generation to wander in the wilderness until they die.  On the plains of Moab, Moses delivers Deuteronomy.  He recites the law, calls Israel to love the Lord wholeheartedly, and sets before them a choice between blessings for obedience and curses for rebellion.  The book concludes with Moses’ farewell and appeal to choose life.

### 4. Joshua 1–6; Judges 2–8, 13–16; Ruth – **Conquest, Chaos and Kindness**

Joshua leads Israel across the Jordan and captures Jericho and other key cities; God fights for His people as they take possession of Canaan.  After Joshua’s death, Israel enters a dark cycle: they forsake God, fall under oppression, cry out and are delivered by judges like Deborah, Gideon and Samson.  Amid this chaos, the story of Ruth highlights fidelity and redemption, pointing toward David’s lineage.

### 5. 1 Samuel 1–3, 8–17; 2 Samuel 5–7, 11–12 – **Kingdom Founded**

Hannah’s prayer and Samuel’s call usher in a prophet who guides Israel.  The people demand a king, and Saul is anointed but eventually rejects God’s word.  David, a shepherd, defeats Goliath and is later crowned king.  God promises David an everlasting dynasty, prefiguring the Messiah.  David’s sin with Bathsheba brings personal and national turmoil, showing the cost of disobedience.

### 6. 1 Kings 1–11; Psalms 23, 51, 103, 139 – **Wisdom and Worship**

Solomon succeeds David, prays for wisdom and builds a magnificent temple.  Israel enjoys peace and prosperity but gradually drifts toward idolatry through Solomon’s many foreign marriages.  Selected psalms capture the heart of Israel’s worship—trust in the Lord as shepherd (23), repentance and mercy (51), praise for God’s benefits (103) and wonder at His intimate knowledge (139).

### 7. 1 Kings 12–19; 2 Kings 2, 5, 17, 25 – **Division and Downfall**

After Solomon’s death the kingdom splits: Israel in the north and Judah in the south.  Kings lead their nations into idolatry or reform with varying zeal.  Prophets like Elijah confront Baal worship and call down fire on Mount Carmel before passing his mantle to Elisha.  Despite warnings, the northern kingdom falls to Assyria and the southern kingdom later collapses under Babylon.  Jerusalem is destroyed and the people go into exile.

### 8. 2 Chronicles 29–36 – **Reforms and Exile**

Chronicles emphasizes temple worship and the fate of Judah’s kings.  Hezekiah restores the temple and reinstitutes the Passover; later, wicked kings undo his work.  Josiah discovers the book of the law and leads a final great reform.  Persistent unfaithfulness results in Babylonian conquest.  The book closes with Cyrus of Persia allowing the captives to return and rebuild.

### 9. Amos 1–5; Hosea 1–3; Micah 4–7; Isaiah 1–11, 40–55; Jeremiah 1–7, 31; Ezekiel 1, 36–37 – **Prophets: Warning and Hope**

The prophets denounce injustice, idolatry and empty ritual.  Amos demands righteousness that rolls like a river; Hosea’s marriage illustrates God’s steadfast love for an unfaithful people.  Micah foretells a ruler born in Bethlehem and a future of peace.  Isaiah combines strong warnings with visions of a suffering servant and a glorious restoration.  Jeremiah laments impending judgment yet promises a new covenant written on hearts.  Ezekiel’s visions of God’s glory, a new heart and the valley of dry bones give hope to the exiles.

### 10. Daniel 1–6; Ezra 1, 3, 7–10; Nehemiah 1–6, 9; Esther 3–8; Haggai 1–2; Zechariah 8–9 – **Exile, Return and Renewal**

Daniel remains faithful in Babylonian courts, interprets dreams and survives the lions’ den.  With Babylon’s fall, waves of exiles return to Judah.  Zerubbabel rebuilds the temple; Ezra restores the law; Nehemiah rebuilds Jerusalem’s walls in the face of opposition and leads a national confession.  Esther shows God’s providential protection of His people in Persia.  Prophets Haggai and Zechariah urge the returned community to finish the temple and look forward to the coming king.

### 11. 1 Maccabees 1–4 – **Struggle for Freedom**

In the second century BC, foreign rulers suppress Jewish worship.  The priestly family of Mattathias and his son Judas Maccabeus leads a revolt to defend the covenant.  Their victories cleanse and rededicate the temple (the origin of Hanukkah) and secure a measure of independence.

### 12. Luke 1–2; Mark; John 1, 3, 6, 13–21 – **Gospel of Christ**

Luke’s opening chapters detail the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, situating the Gospel in history.  Mark narrates Jesus’ ministry with urgency—miracles, teaching and the call to discipleship—culminating in His death and resurrection.  John’s Gospel emphasizes Jesus’ divine identity as the Word made flesh, the bread of life and the servant who washes His disciples’ feet.  It concludes with the risen Lord commissioning His followers.

### 13. Acts 1–12, 15, 27–28; Romans 1–8; 1 Corinthians 13–15; Ephesians 1–6; Revelation 1–5, 19–22 – **Church and Consummation**

Acts records the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome.  Peter and Paul preach, perform miracles and plant churches.  Paul’s letters to the Romans and Ephesians unpack salvation by grace, the unity of Jew and Gentile, and the nature of the Church as Christ’s body.  In 1 Corinthians he proclaims the centrality of the resurrection.  Revelation opens with letters to seven churches and unveils cosmic scenes of worship, conflict and the ultimate victory of God.  It ends with the promise of a new heaven and new earth where God dwells with His people.
